LazyImageForLazy
================
This is for Lazy Image Loading Test.
Not so pretty code, 'cause it's just for simulating.

No TDD

'Array Retained' is good and basic, but...
All of Images have to be in "Local Memory"!!

'Operation' method is good, but...
cell reuse can conflict !!

image THUMBNAILizing is not included.
